  <button class="accordion">Education at all levels from pre-school to adult education</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If you have a background in education then you have come to the right organisation. Our partners specialise in education across the four countries that we work in. There are opportunities to work in main stream education, special needs settings, a school for the deaf as well as delivering staff in-service or tutoring in a teacher training college.  We are particularly interested in hearing from primary and secondary teachers for our annual summer school programmes (see below). We can also offer placements during term-time to those who are on career-break from teaching</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) Teaching</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As English is the language of education, business, science and technology in Ethiopia, Kenya and Ghana, volunteers with the ability to teach English are appreciated in many of our project settings. There are also opportunities to teach English one-to-one or with small adult groups as partner project staff members always seek to improve and up-skill their English language abilities. Business English is a valuable skill for managing projects, researching best practice, working with funders, volunteers and presenting their work to foreign visitors.</p>
</div>
	
<button class="accordion">Sign Language, working with the Deaf and Hard of Hearing</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>VLM’s flagship project is the Ambo Lazarist School for the Deaf in central Ethiopia. Visit Ethiopia Deaf Project to learn more about the project. We seek volunteers who can communicate through sign language and have experience with the Deaf community or those who are hard of hearing. There are various opportunities at this project, </p>
</div>
	
<button class="accordion">Childcare, Youth or Community Work</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>All of the projects that VLM volunteers work in are community focused and dedicated to empowering people to move out of poverty and marginalisation. Volunteers with experience in childcare, youth and/or community work – from frontline to leadership roles – have valuable skills to add here. For example, previous volunteers have worked with young adults at risk of exploitation, in Montessori schools and have delivered awareness courses on child safeguarding to various community and interest groups</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Physical Education and Coaching</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Sports can cross cultural and language barriers. Volunteers with a qualification and interest in various sports (particularly soccer, basketball, volleyball and athletics) are sought annually for our summer school programme. There are also a limited number of placements for volunteers with qualifications and experience in teaching martial arts, yoga, pilates, meditation and similar practices.</p>
</div>


<button class="accordion">Creative Arts, Crafts, Photography or Music</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The creative arts play a main role in our annual summer school programme, where English is taught through art, music, dance, drama and expression. There is also scope for volunteers with these skills to join us at other times of the year. 

Needlework and dressmaking skills are welcomed in many of our partner projects whose focus is on empowering young women towards independence.

We are also seeking volunteers with photography and videography skills to work with projects on photo-documenting their work, reporting to funders, creating and updating websites and spreading the good news about their achievements to date</p>
</div>
	

<button class="accordion">Leadership, Project Management, Funding Grant and Proposal Writing</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Our partner projects strive to serve people to standards of best practice. They also aim to grow and develop their project programmes to respond to the needs of their communities at the time and into the future. Volunteers with expertise in planning for sustainability, project leadership, community development, needs assessments or research are welcome on board in mentoring or capacity building roles. 

As projects seek to develop or to maintain their valuable services, there is also the ongoing work to acquire funding through donors and international agencies alongside the monitoring, evaluation and reporting to funders on project progress. Potential volunteers who believe that this would be interesting and rewarding work to become involved with, are encouraged to get in touch with us here at VLM. </p>
</div>


<button class="accordion">Business, Entrepreneurship, Book-Keeping or Governance</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Similar to leadership and project management, many volunteers possess transferrable skills from the worlds of business and finance. These skills are greatly valued by our partners overseas as they seek to secure funding and generate income for projects while also accompaning individual families towards self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship.</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">Administration, Office Work, Proof-Reading and IT</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Many people approach VLM with the desire to volunteer but feel that they have no skills to offer. In fact, basic office skills in IT, MS office and the ability to prepare letters and documents can give the much needed administrative support to our project leaders overseas. As fluent English speakers many of our volunteers are invaluable in proof-reading documents and helping local staff build their capacity in basic computer and administration skills.</p>
